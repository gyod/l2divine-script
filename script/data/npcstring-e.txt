1000053	a,According to the command of Beleth... I'm going to observe you guys!\0
1000054	a,You people make me sick! No sense of loyalty whatsoever!\0
1000055	a,A challenge against me is the same as a challenge against Beleth...\0
1000056	a,Beleth is always watching over you guys!\0
1000057	a,That was really close! Antharas opened its eyes!\0
1000058	a,You who disobey the will of Antharas! Die!\0

1000068	a,The joy of killing! The ecstasy of looting! Hey guys, let's have a go at it again!\0
1000069	a,There really are still lots of folks in the world without fear! I'll teach you a lesson!\0
1000070	a,If you hand over everything you've got, I'll at least spare your life!\0

1000076	a,Present the lives of four people to Antharas!\0
1000077	a,This is unbelievable! How could I have lost to one so inferior to myself?\0
1000078	a,I carry the power of darkness and have returned from the abyss.\0
1000079	a,It's detestable.\0
1000080	a,I finally find rest...\0
1000081	a,Glory to Orfen!\0

1000084	a,Even if you disappear into nothingness, you will still face the life-long suffering of the curse that I have given you.\0
1000085	a,I'll stand against anyone that makes light of the sacred place of the Elves!\0
1000086	a,I will kill with my own hands anyone that defiles our home!\0
1000087	a,My brothers will never rest until we push you and your gang out of this valley!\0
1000088	a,Until the day of destruction of Hestui!\0
1000089	a,If any intrepid Orcs remain, attack them!\0
1000090	a,I'll break your windpipe!\0
1000091	a,Is revenge a failure?!\0
1000092	a,The sparkling mithril of the dwarves and their pretty treasures! I'll get them all!\0
1000093	a,Where are all the dreadful dwarves and their sparkling things?\0
1000094	a,Hand over your pretty treasures!\0
1000095	a,Hey! You should have run away!\0
1000096	a,DESTRUCTION - EXTINCTION - SLAUGHTER - COLLAPSE! DESTRUCTION - EXTINCTION - SLAUGHTER - COLLAPSE!\0
1000097	a,Destruction! Destruction! Destruction! Destruction!\0

1000101	a,Whew! He's quite a guy!\0
1000102	a,How exasperating and unfair to have things happen in such a meaningless way like this...\0
1000103	a,This world should be filled with fear and sadness...\0
1000104	a,I won't forgive the world that cursed me!\0
1000105	a,I'll make everyone feel the same suffering as me!\0
1000106	a,I'll give you a curse that you'll never be able to remove forever!\0
1000107	a,I'll get revenge on you who slaughtered my compatriots!\0
1000108	a,Those who are afraid should get away and those who are brave should fight!\0
1000109	a,I've got power from Beleth so do you think I'll be easily defeated?!\0
1000110	a,I am leaving now, but soon someone will come who will teach you all a lesson!\0
1000111	a,Hey guys, let's make a round of our territory!\0
1000112	a,The rumor is that there are wild, uncivilized ruffians who have recently arrived in my territory.\0
1000113	a,Do you know who I am?! I am Sirocco! Everyone, attack!\0
1000114	a,What's just happened?! The invincible Sirocco was defeated by someone like you?!\0
1000115	a,Oh, I'm really hungry...\0
1000116	a,I smell food. Ooh...\0
1000117	a,Ooh...\0
1000118	a,What does honey of this place taste like?!\0
1000119	a,Give me some sweet, delicious golden honey!\0
1000120	a,If you give me some honey, I'll at least spare your life...\0
1000121	a,Only for lack of honey did I lose to the likes of you.\0
1000122	a,Where is the traitor Kuroboros!?\0
1000123	a,Look in every nook and cranny around here!\0
1000124	a,Are you Lackey of Kuroboros?! I'll knock you out in one shot!\0
1000125	a,He just closed his eyes without disposing of the traitor... How unfair!\0
1000126	a,Hell for unbelievers in Kuroboros!\0
1000127	a,The person that does not believe in Kuroboros, his life will soon become hell!\0
1000128	a,The lackey of that demented devil, the servant of a false god! I'll send that fool straight to hell!\0
1000129	a,Uh... I'm not dying; I'm just disappearing for a moment... I'll resurrect again!\0
1000130	a,Hail to Kuroboros, the founder of our religion!\0
1000131	a,Only those who believe in Patriarch Kuroboros shall receive salvation!\0
1000132	a,Are you the ones that Sharuk has incited?! You also should trust in Kuroboros and be saved!\0
1000133	a,Kuroboros will punish you.\0
1000134	a,You who have beautiful spirits that shine brightly! I have returned!\0
1000135	a,You that are weary and exhausted... Entrust your souls to me.\0
1000136	a,The color of your soul is very attractive.\0
1000137	a,Those of you who live! Do you know how beautiful your souls are?!\0
1000138	a,It... will... kill... everyone...\0
1000139	a,I'm... so... lonely...\0
1000140	a,My... enemy...!\0
1000141	a,... Now... I'm not so lonely!\0
1000142	a,I will never forgive the Pixy Murika... that is trying to... kill us!\0
1000143	a,Attack all the dull and stupid followers of Murika!\0
1000144	a,I didn't have any idea about such ambitions!\0
1000145	a,This is not the end... It's just the beginning.\0
1000146	a,Hey... Shall we have some fun for the first time in a long while?...\0
1000147	a,There've been some things going around like crazy here recently...\0
1000148	a,Hey! Do you know who I am? I am Malex, Herald of Dagoniel! Attack!\0
1000149	a,What's just happened?! The invincible Malex just lost to the likes of you?!\0
1000150	a,It's something repeated in a vain life...\0
1000151	a,Shake in fear, all you who value your lives!\0
1000152	a,I'll make you feel suffering like a flame that is never extinguished!\0
1000153	a,Back to the dirt...\0
1000154	a,Hail Varika!!\0
1000155	a,Nobody can stop us!\0
1000156	a,You move slowly!\0
1000157	a,Varika! Go first!\0
1000158	a,Where am I? Who am I?\0
1000159	a,Uh... My head hurts like it's going to burst! Who am I?\0
1000160	a,You jerk. You're a devil! You're a devil to have made me like this!\0
1000161	a,Where am I? What happened? Thank you!\0
1000162	a,Ukru Master!\0

1000181	a,Sacred magical research is conducted here.\0
1000182	a,Behold the awesome power of magic!\0
1000183	a,Your powers are impressive but you must not annoy our high level sorcerer.\0
1000184	a,I am Barda, master of the Bandit Stronghold!\0
1000185	a,I, Master Barda, once owned that stronghold,\0
1000186	a,Ah, very interesting!\0
1000187	a,You are more powerful than you appear. We'll meet again!\0
1000188	a,You filthy sorcerers disgust me!\0
1000189	a,Why would you build a tower in our territory?\0
1000190	a,Are you part of that evil gang of sorcerers?\0
1000191	a,That is why I don't bother with anyone below the level of sorcerer.\0
1000192	a,Ah, another beautiful day!\0
1000193	a,Our specialties are arson and looting.\0
1000194	a,You will leave empty-handed!\0
1000195	a,Ah, so you admire my treasure, do you? Try finding it! Ha!\0
1000196	a,Is everybody listening? Sirion has come back. Everyone chant and bow...\0
1000197	a,Bow down, you worthless humans!\0
1000198	a,Very tacky!\0
1000199	a,Don't think that you are invincible just because you defeated me!\0
1000200	a,The material desires of mortals are ultimately meaningless.\0
1000201	a,Do not forget the reason the Tower of Insolence collapsed.\0
1000202	a,You humans are all alike, full of greed and avarice!\0
1000203	a,All for nothing,\0
1000204	a,What are all these people doing here?\0
1000205	a,I must find the secret of eternal life, here among these rotten angels!\0
1000206	a,Do you also seek the secret of immortality?\0
1000207	a,I shall never reveal my secrets!\0
1000208	a,Who dares enter this place?\0
1000209	a,This is no place for humans! You must leave immediately.\0
1000210	a,You poor creatures! Too stupid to realize your own ignorance!\0
1000211	a,You mustn't go there!\0
1000212	a,Who dares disturb this marsh?\0
1000213	a,The humans must not be allowed to destroy the marshland for their greedy purposes.\0
1000214	a,You are a brave man...\0
1000215	a,You idiots! Some day you shall also be gone!\0
1000216	a,Someone has entered the forest...\0
1000217	a,The forest is very quiet and peaceful.\0
1000218	a,Stay here in this wonderful forest!\0
1000219	a,My... my souls...\0
1000220	a,This forest is a dangerous place.\0
1000221	a,Unless you leave this forest immediately you are bound to run into serious trouble.\0
1000222	a,Leave now!\0
1000223	a,Why do you ignore my warning?\0
1000224	a,Harits of the world... I bring you peace!\0
1000225	a,Harits! Be courageous!\0
1000226	a,I shall eat your still-beating heart!.\0
1000227	a,Harits! Keep faith until the day I return... Never lose hope!\0
1000228	a,Even the giants are gone! There's nothing left to be afraid of now!\0
1000229	a,Have you heard of the giants? Their downfall was inevitable!\0
1000230	a,What nerve! Do you dare to challenge me?\0
1000231	a,You are as evil as the giants...\0
1000232	a,This dungeon is still in good condition!\0
1000233	a,This place is spectacular, wouldn't you say?\0
1000234	a,You are very brave warriors!\0
1000235	a,Are the giants truly gone for good?\0
1000236	a,These graves are good.\0
1000237	a,Gold and silver are meaningless to a dead man!\0
1000238	a,Why would those corrupt aristocrats bury such useful things?\0
1000239	a,You filthy pig! Eat and be merry now that you have shirked your responsibilities!\0
1000240	a,Those thugs! It would be too merciful to rip them apart and chew them up one at a time!\0
1000241	a,You accursed scoundrels!\0
1000242	a,Hmm, could this be the assassin sent by those idiots from Aden?\0
1000243	a,I shall curse your name with my last breath!\0
1000244	a,My beloved Lord Shilen.\0
1000245	a,I must break the seal and release Lord Shilen as soon as possible...\0
1000246	a,You shall taste the vengeance of Lord Shilen!\0
1000247	a,Lord Shilen... some day... you will accomplish... this mission...\0
1000248	a,Towards immortality...\0
1000249	a,He who desires immortality... Come unto me.\0
1000250	a,You shall be sacrificed to gain my immortality!\0
1000251	a,Eternal life in front of my eyes... I have collapsed in such a worthless way like this...\0
1000252	a,Zaken, you are a cowardly cur!\0
1000253	a,You are immortal, aren't you, Zaken?\0
1000254	a,Please return my body to me.\0
1000255	a,Finally... will I be able to rest?\0
1000256	a,What is all that racket?\0
1000257	a,Master Gildor does not like to be disturbed.\0
1000258	a,Please, just hold it down...\0
1000259	a,If you disturb Master Gildor I won't be able to help you.\0
1000260	a,Who dares approach?\0
1000261	a,These reeds are my territory...\0
1000262	a,You fools! Today you shall learn a lesson!\0
1000263	a,The past goes by... Is a new era beginning?...\0
1000264	a,This is the garden of Eva.\0
1000265	a,The garden of Eva is a sacred place.\0
1000266	a,Do you mean to insult Eva?\0
1000267	a,How rude!  Eva's love is available to all, even to an ill-mannered lout like yourself!\0
1000268	a,This place once belonged to Lord Shilen.\0
1000269	a,Leave this palace to us, spirits of Eva.\0
1000270	a,Why are you getting in our way?\0
1000271	a,Shilen... our Shilen!\0
1000272	a,All who fear of Fafurion... Leave this place at once!\0
1000273	a,You are being punished in the name of Fafurion!\0
1000274	a,Oh, master... please forgive your humble servant...\0
1000275	a,Prepare to die, foreign invaders! I am Gustav, the eternal ruler of this fortress and I have taken up my sword to repel thee!\0
1000276	a,Glory to Aden, the Kingdom of the Lion! Glory to Sir Gustav, our immortal lord!\0
1000277	a,Soldiers of Gustav, go forth and destroy the invaders!\0
1000278	a,This is unbelievable! Have I really been defeated? I shall return and take your head!\0
1000279	a,Could it be that I have reached my end? I cannot die without honor, without the permission of Sir Gustav!\0
1000280	a,Ah, the bitter taste of defeat... I fear my torments are not over...\0
1000281	a,I follow the will of Fafurion.\0

2152	a,Please check this bookcase, $s1.\0
2150	a,Who awoke me?\0
2250	a,Did you call me, $s1?\0
2251	a,I'm confused! Maybe it's time to go back.\0
2550	a,That box was sealed by my master, $s1! Don't touch it!\0
2551	a,You've ended my immortal life! You're protected by the feudal lord, aren't you?\0
2450	a,That sign!\0
7050	a,You made it here, $s1. I'll show my strength. Die! \0
7051	a,Ha! You failed! Are you ready to quit?\0
7052	a,I'm the strongest! I lost everything to win!\0
7053	a,$s1! Are you doing this because they're Halisha's minions?\0
7054	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7055	a,Mind your own business!\0
7056	a,This fight is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7057	a,Every cloud has a silver lining, don't you think?\0
7058	a,$s1! Don't listen to this demon.\0
7059	a,$s1! Hesitation betrays your heart. Fight!\0
7060	a,$s1! Isn't protecting somebody worthy? Isn't that justice?\0
7061	a,I have urgent business! I gotta go.\0
7062	a,Are my efforts in vain? Is this the end?\0
7063	a,Goodbye, friend. I hope to see you again.\0
7064	a,Knights are always foolish!\0
7065	a,I'll show mercy on you for now.\0
7066	a,$s1! Your justice is just hypocrisy if you give up on what you've promised to protect.\0
7067	a,$s1...Don't think you've won! Your dark shadow will always follow you...hypocrite!\0
7150	a,A temple knight guards the Mother Tree! $s1! Has Human contact made you forget that?\0
7151	a,I must stop. Remember, the ones you're protecting will someday defeat the Elves.\0
7152	a,What! That will just strengthen the enemy!\0
7153	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7154	a,My spirit is releasing from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7155	a,Mind your own business!\0
7156	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0

7159	a,Don't give up, $s1! He' a demon from the past!\0
7160	a,Be proud, $s1. We protect this world together.\0
7161	a,I have to go. I've got some business to take care of.\0

7251	a,Huh? It's curtain time! I won't get any money.\0
7252	a,Ugh...It can't be...!\0
7253	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7254	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7255	a,Mind your own business!\0
7256	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7257	a,You won't get away this time, Narcissus!\0
7258	a,$s1! Help me!\0
7259	a,You must be aware of your audience when singing, %s! => Join us $s1! A song that nobody listens to is empty.\0
7260	a,You must work harder to be victorious, $s1.\0
7261	a,My song is over, I must go. Goodbye!\0
7262	a,How could I miss!\0
7263	a,Don't forget. Song comes with harmony.\0
7264	a,Sing. Everyone will listen.\0
7265	a,You don't deserve my blessing.\0
7266	a,Do you reject my blessing, $s1?\0
7267	a,But why, $s1. Everyone would praise you!\0
7350	a,$s1! Attack me? I'm immortal! I'm unrivaled!\0
7351	a,Ha! I'm immortal. This scar will soon heal. You'll die next time.\0
7352	a,Metellus! You promised me an immortal life! How could I, Swordmaster Iron, lose?\0
7353	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7354	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7355	a,Mind your own business!\0
7356	a,This is a waste of time... Goodbye!\0
7357	a,Fallen Angel? It's worth trying.\0
7358	a,Hey $s1! Why don't you join? It's your best shot!\0
7359	a,Are you interested in immortal life, $s1? It's too boring for me.\0
7360	a,Excellent, $s1! Show me what you learned when your life was on the line!\0
7361	a,I have to go take a break.\0
7362	a,You missed?! What a fool you are!\0
7363	a,Fighting without risk, training without danger and growing without hardship will only lead to an inflated ego. Don't forget.\0
7364	a,Do you want an immortal life?\0
7365	a,Think it over. An immortal life and assured victory...\0
7366	a,That's good, $s1! Do you want my blessing to improve your skills?\0
7367	a,$s1! Why do you reject guaranteed victory?\0
7450	a,In the name of gods, I punish you, $s1! You can't rival us all, no matter how strong you think you are!\0
7451	a,I have to stop for now, but I'll defeat the power of the dragon yet!\0
7452	a,It is...The power that shouldn't live!\0
7453	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7454	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7455	a,Mind your own business!\0
7456	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7457	a,Isn't it unwise for an angel to interfere in Human affairs?\0
7458	a,This is tough! $s1, would you help me?\0
7459	a,$s1! He's keeping an eye on all those in succession to the blood of dragons, including you!\0
7460	a,Attack the rear, $s1! If I'm killed, you're next!\0
7461	a,I can't stay any longer. There are too many eyes on us. Farewell!\0
7462	a,Get away? You're still alive. But...\0
7463	a,If we can't avoid this fight, we'll need great strength. It's the only way to peace.\0
7464	a,Warlord, you'll never learn the techniques of the dragon!\0
7465	a,Hey, why bother with this. Isn't it your mother's business?\0
7466	a,$s1! Are you against your mother's wishes? You're not worthy of the secrets of Shilen's children!\0
7467	a,Excellent technique, $s1. Unfortunately, you're the one destined for tragedy!\0
7550	a,$s1! You may follow me, but an Orc is no match for my giant's strength!\0
7551	a,Kuh...My body fails..This is the end!\0
7552	a,How could I lose with the powers of a giant? Aargh!!!\0
7553	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7554	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7555	a,Mind your own business!\0
7556	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7557	a,That's the enemy.\0
7558	a,Hmm.. $s1! Will you just stand there doing nothing?\0
7559	a,$s1. Nothing risked, nothing gained. Only those who fight enjoy the spoils of victory.\0
7560	a,A sword isn't jewelry, $s1. Don't you agree?\0
7561	a,With no fight, I have no reason to stay.\0
7562	a,Miss...\0
7563	a,Pick your battles wisely, or you'll regret it.\0
7564	a,What a fool to challenge the giant of the Oroka tribe!\0
7565	a,Running low on steam. I must withdraw.\0
7566	a,$s1. You're the one who defeated Guardian Muhark!\0
7567	a,$s1....! I must succeed...\0
7650	a,$s1... Would you fight Uruz, who has reached the power of Azira?\0
7651	a,I can't handle the power of Azira yet. First...\0
7652	a,This can't be happening! I have the power of Azira! How could I fall so easily?\0
7653	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7654	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7655	a,Mind your own business!\0
7656	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7657	a,Azira, born from the Evil Flame, I'll kill you with my bare hands!\0
7658	a,$s1! In the name of Khavatari Hubai, strike this evil with your fists!\0
7659	a,$s1! Attack from both sides! Hit hard!\0
7660	a,$s1! Strike with all your heart. It must work.\0
7661	a,Damn! It's time to go. Until next time.\0
7662	a,Evil Flame Spirit! I won't give up!\0
7663	a,My fist works even on the evil spirit. Don't forget!\0
7664	a,Foolish Khavatari...Do you think your power will work on me? I'm the source of your martial art!\0
7665	a,No more games...\0
7666	a,$s1...Are you next after Khavatari? Do you know who I am?\0
7667	a,$s1...Kashu. Not a bad attack. I can't hold on much longer.\0
7750	a,$s1, Akkan, you can't be my rival! I'll kill everything! I'll be the king!\0
7751	a,Ha! I'll show mercy on you this time. I know well of your technique!\0
7752	a,I have in me the blood of a king! How could I lose?!\0
7753	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7754	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7755	a,Mind your own business!\0
7756	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7757	a,Are you....tyrant!\0
7758	a,You're not a king! You're just a tyrant! $s1, we must fight together!\0
7759	a,Such rule is ruining the country! $s1, I can't bear this tyranny any longer!\0
7760	a,$s1, leaders must always resist tyranny!\0
7761	a,I stayed too long. I'll be punished for being away so long.\0
7762	a,He got away, Dammit! We must catch this dark soul!\0
7763	a,What is a king? What must one do to be a good king? Think it over.\0
7764	a,Kneel down before me! Foolish people!\0
7765	a,It's time for the king to leave! Bow your head and say goodbye!\0
7766	a,$s1! You dare to fight me? A king's power must be great to rule!\0
7767	a,You would fight the king, $s1? Traitor!\0
7850	a,Tejakar Sharuhi! $s1, I'll show you the power of Sharuhi Mouth Mudaha!\0
7851	a,Aaargh! My soul won't keep quiet. Now I must take my leave.\0
7852	a,No, Sharuhi. You're soul is mine!\0
7853	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7854	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7855	a,Mind your own business!\0
7856	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7857	a,Tejakar Oroca! Tejakar Duda-Mara!\0
7858	a,$s1, we must fight this soul together to prevent an everlasting winter!\0
7859	a,$s1! The soul responds to you. May your attack quiet him!\0
7860	a,$s1! Calm Sharuhi! He doesn't listen to me anymore.\0
7861	a,It's time to go! May the eternal flame bless you!\0
7862	a,He left...That's too bad..Too bad...\0
7863	a,Don't forget your strong will now!\0
7864	a,Ha! Nobody will rule over me anymore!\0
7865	a,Freedom... freedom... freedom!\0
7866	a,$s1, You released me, but you also want to catch me. Ha!\0
7867	a,...$s1...Me?....All right...I'll help you.\0

8051	a,Leave before you are severely punished!\0
8052	a,Einhasad, don't give up on me!\0
8053	a,$s1, so you're the one who's looking for me?\0

1800172	a,Very good. Your skill makes you a model for other adventurers to follow.\0
1800173	a,Good work. If all adventurers produce results like you, we will slowly start to see the glimmer of hope.\0
1800174	a,Unfortunately, it seems that Rim Kamaloka cannot be easily approached by everyone.\0

1800186	a,Ahh! How did he find my weakness?\0
1800187	a,We were able to successfully collect the Essence of Kamaloka from the Kanabions that you defeated. Here they are.\0
1800188	a,But we were able to collect somehow the Essence of Kamaloka from the Kanabions that you defeated. Here they are.\0
1800189	a,I'm sorry, but we were unable to collect the Essence of Kamaloka from the Kanabions that you defeated because their dark energy was too weak.\0
1800190	a,Rather than simply defeating the enemies, you seem to understand our goal and purpose as well.\0
1800191	a,Dopplers and Voids possess an enhanced amount of the Kanabions' dark energy, so it is important to concentrate on defeating them when blocking the Kamalokians attack.\0
1800192	a,Have you seen Kanabions being remade as new Kanabions sometimes? You can see it occur more often by inflicting great damage during an attack or at the moment you defeat them.\0

1800819	a,How refreshing! You wouldn't happen to be a master masseuse, $s1, would you?\0
1800820	a,Incredible. From now on, I'll compare all massages to this one with $s1!\0

1800935	a,Look~!! It's gonna break~!\0
1800936	a,Now! Are you trying to eat without doing the work? Fine~ Do what you want~ I'll hate you if you don't give me any nectar!\0
1800937	a,Hit me more! Hit me more!\0
1800938	a,I'm gonna wither like this~ Damn it~!\0
1800939	a,Hey you~ If I die like this, there'll be no item either~ Are you really so stingy with the nectar?\0
1800940	a,It's just a little more!! Good luck~!\0
1800941	a,Save me~ I'm about to die without tasting nectar even once~\0
1800942	a,If I die like this, I'll just be a watermelon slice~!\0
1800943	a,I'm getting stronger~? I think I'll be able to run away in 30 seconds~ Hoho~\0

1800947	a,I'm leaving in 1 minutes if you don't give me any nectar~!\0
1800948	a,I'm leaving now~! Then, goodbye~!\0
1800949	a,Sorry, but this large watermelon is disappearing here~!\0
1800950	a,Too late~! Have a good time~!\0
1800951	a,Ding ding~ That's the bell. Put away your weapons and try for next time~!\0
1800952	a,Too bad~! You raised it up, too! -_-\0
1800953	a,Oh~ What a nice sound~\0
1800954	a,The instrument is nice, but there's no song. Shall I sing for you?\0
1800955	a,What beautiful music!\0
1800956	a,I feel good~ Play some more!\0
1800957	a,My heart is being captured by the sound of Crono!\0
1800958	a,Get the notes right~! Hey old man~ That was wrong!\0
1800959	a,I like it~!\0
1800960	a,Ooh~~ My body wants to open!\0
1800961	a,Oh~! This chord! My heart is being torn! Play a little more!\0
1800962	a,It's this~ This! I wanted this sound! Why don't you try becoming a singer?\0
1800963	a,You can try a hundred times on this~ You won't get anything good~!\0
1800964	a,It hurts~! Play just the instrument~!\0
1800965	a,Only good music can open my body!\0
1800966	a,Not this, but you know, that~ What you got as a Chronicle souvenir. Play with that!\0
1800967	a,Why~ You have no music? Boring... I'm leaving now~\0
1800968	a,Not those sharp things~! Use the ones that make nice sounds!\0
1800969	a,Large watermelons only open with music~ Just striking with a weapon won't work~!\0
1800970	a,Strike with music~! Not with something like this. You need music~!\0
1800971	a,You're pretty amazing~! But it's all for nothing~~!\0
1800972	a,Use that on monsters, OK? I want Crono~!\0
1800973	a,Everyone~ The watermelon is breaking!!!\0
1800974	a,It's like a watermelon slice~!\0
1800975	a,A goblin is coming out(?)!\0
1800976	a,Large watermelon~! Make a wish!!\0
1800977	a,Don't tell anyone about my death~\0
1800978	a,Ugh~ The red juice is flowing out!\0
1800979	a,This is all~\0
1800980	a,Kyaahh!!! I'm mad...!\0
1800981	a,Everyone~ This watermelon broke open!! The item is falling out!\0
1800982	a,Oh! It burst! The contents are spilling out~\0
1800983	a,Hohoho~ Play better!\0
1800984	a,Oh~!! You're very talented, huh~?\0
1800985	a,Play some more! More!  More!  More!\0
1800986	a,I eat hits and grow!!\0
1800987	a,Buck up~ There isn't much time~\0
1800988	a,Do you think I'll burst with just that~?\0
1800989	a,What a nice attack~ You might be able to kill a passing fly~\0
1800990	a,Right there! A little to the right~! Ah~ Refreshing.\0
1800991	a,You call that hitting? Bring some more talented friends!\0
1800992	a,Don't think! Just hit! We're hitting!\0
1800993	a,I need nectar~ Gourd nectar!\0
1800994	a,I can only grow by drinking nectar~\0
1800995	a,Grow me quick! If you're good, it's a large watermelon. If you're bad, it a watermelon slice~!\0
1800996	a,Gimme nectar~ I'm hungry~\0
1800997	a,Hurry and bring me nectar... Not a necktie~... (sorry)\0
1800998	a,Bring me nectar. Then, I'll drink and grow!\0
1800999	a,You wanna eat a tiny watermelon like me? Try giving me some nectar. I'll get huge~!\0
1801000	a,Hehehe... Grow me well and you'll get a reward. Grow me bad and who knows what'll happen~\0
1801001	a,You want a large watermelon? I'd like to be a watermelon slice~\0
1801002	a,Trust me and bring me some nectar!! I'll become a large watermelon for you~!\0
1801003	a,I see. Beleth has recovered all of its magic power. What remains here is just its trace.\0
1801004	a,Command Channel Leader $s1, Beleth' Ring has been acquired.\0
1801005	a,You summoned me, so you must be confident, huh? Here I come! Jack game!\0

1801007	a,I'm starting! Now, show me the card you want!\0
1801008	a,We'll start now! Show me the card you want!\0
1801009	a,I'm showing the Rotten Pumpkin Card!\0

1801011	a,I'm showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!\0
1801012	a,I'll be showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!\0
1801013	a,That's my precious Fantastic Chocolate Banana Ultra Favor Candy!!! I'm definitely winning the next round!!\0
1801014	a,It's my precious candy, but... I'll happily give it to you~!\0
1801015	a,The candy fell. I'll give you my toy chest instead.\0
1801016	a,Since the candy fell, I will give you my toy chest instead.\0
1801017	a,You're not peeking at my card, are you? This time, I'll wager a special scroll.\0
1801018	a,We're getting serious now. If you win again, I'll give you a special scroll.\0
1801019	a,You could probably enter the underworld pro league!\0
1801020	a,Even pros can't do this much. You're amazing.\0
1801021	a,Who's the monster here?! This time, I'll bet my precious Transformation Stick.\0
1801022	a,I lost again. I won't lose this time. I'm betting my Transformation Stick.\0
1801023	a,Lost again! Hmph. Next time, I'll bet an incredible gift! Wait for it if you want!\0
1801024	a,You're too good. Next time, I'll give you an incredible gift! Please wait for you.\0
1801025	a,My pride can't handle you winning anymore!\0
1801026	a,I would be embarrassing to lose again here...\0
1801027	a,What's your name? I'm gonna remember you!\0
1801028	a,People from the above ground world are really good at games.\0
1801029	a,You've played a lot in the underworld, haven't you?!\0
1801030	a,I've never met someone so good before.\0
1801031	a,13 wins in a row. You're pretty lucky today, huh?\0
1801032	a,I never thought I would see 13 wins in a row.\0
1801033	a,This is the best record I've seen! Next time I'll give you my treasure -- the Golden Jack O'Lantern!\0
1801034	a,Even pros can't do 14 wins...! Next time I'll give you my treasure -- the Golden Jack O'Lantern!\0
1801035	a,I can't do this anymore! You win! I acknowledge you as the best I've ever met in all my 583 years!\0
1801036	a,Playing any more is meaningless. You were my greatest opponent.\0
1801037	a,I won this round...! It was fun.\0
1801038	a,I won this round. It was enjoyable.\0
1801039	a,Above world people are so fun...! Then, see you later!\0
1801040	a,Call me again next time. I want to play again with you.\0
1801041	a,You wanna play some more? I'm out of presents, but I'll give you candy!\0
1801042	a,Will you play some more? I don't have any more presents, but I will give you candy if you win.\0
1801043	a,You're the best. Out of all the Jack's game players I've ever met... I give up!\0
1801044	a,Wowww. Awesome. Really. I have never met someone as good as you before. Now... I can't play anymore.\0
1801045	a,$s1 has won $s2 Jack's games in a row.\0
1801046	a,Congratulations! $s1 has won $s2 Jack's games in a row.\0
1801047	a,Congratulations on getting 1st place in Jack's game!\0
1801048	a,Hello~! I'm Belldandy. Congratulations on winning 1st place in Jack's game... If you go and find my sibling Skooldie in the village, you'll get an amazing gift! Let's play Jack's game again!\0
1801049	a,Hmm. You're playing Jack's game for the first time, huh? You couldn't even take out your card at the right time~! My goodness...\0
1801050	a,Oh. You're not very familiar with Jack's game, right? You didn't take out your card at the right time...\0
1801051	a,You have to use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.\0
1801052	a,You must use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.\0
1801053	a,If you show the same card as me, you win. If they're different, I win. Understand? Now, let's go!\0
1801054	a,You will win if you show the same card as me. It's my victory if the cards are different. Well, let's start again~\0
1801055	a,Ack! You didn't show a card? You have to use the card skill before the gauge disappears. Hmph. Then, I'm going.\0
1801056	a,Ahh. You didn't show a card. You must use the card skill at the right time. It's unfortunate. Then, I will go now~\0
1801057	a,Let's learn about the Jack's game together~! You can play with me 3 times.\0
1801058	a,Let's start! Show the card you want! The card skill is attached to the mask.\0
1801059	a,You showed the same card as me, so you win.\0
1801060	a,You showed a different card from me, so you lose.\0
1801061	a,That was practice, so there's no candy even if you win~\0
1801062	a,It's unfortunate. Let's practice one more time.\0
1801063	a,You gotta show the card at the right time. Use the card skill you want before the gauge above my head disappears!\0
1801064	a,The card skills are attached to the Jack O'Lantern mask, right? That's what you use.\0
1801065	a,You win if you show the same card as me, and I win if the cards are different. OK, let's go~\0
1801066	a,You didn't show a card again? We'll try again later. I'm gonna go now~\0

1900163	a,Flesh rips...bone crushes. Haha...hehehe...it's red. All!\0
1900164	a,I do not...want to die. I don't want to...die miserably like that!\0
1900165	a,Go away! I do not want to see anyone! No... Don't leave me! I'm scared!\0
1900166	a,I didn't want to see. Hehe.. But, I saw.. I saw! Hehehehe!\0
1900167	a,I heard the sound. Sound of the hell!\0
1900168	a,Let me.. live!! Please! Help me! That black ground is trying to swallow me!\0
1900169	a,Hundreds and thousands of monsters turned into flesh! Kehehehe!\0
1900170	a,I was swallowed after smashed. By darkness! Into the darkness!\0
1900171	a,I don't like it! Don't touch me! Please.. I beg you... Sniff... Sniff...\0
1900172	a,Sweet voice. Hehe.. You die if you get possessed by that sound. Like them! Hehe...hahaha!\0
1900173	a,They will resurrect. She will... They will... Heh... \0
1900174	a,Dead.. or alive... I don't want to see anything..\0
1900175	a,Death. No one can do anything! Deep! Deep death!\0
1900176	a,Even if you try, it's useless. Die with me. Keheheh!\0
1900177	a,Dark voice.. Can you hear? I.. can hear.. But... I don't want to.. \0
1900178	a,I can still hear the sound.. of flesh and bones grinding. Hehehehe!\0
1900179	a,Eek! Run away! If you want to live... If you want to stay alive! Leave here! Right now!\0
1900180	a,You don't want to die? But, you'll die soon. Keheheh!\0
1900181	a,There's no chance! No chance at all! You! And I will! Become red flesh! Keheheh!\0
1900182	a,Die! Before she swallows you! Die!\0
1900183	a,Don't wanna die. But, I can't live either. Sniff... Sniff... \0
1900184	a,Eek! Don't kill me! I don't wanna die. I don't wanna become a patty of meat.. No.. No! \0
1900185	a,I can hear.. the bone crushing sound..\0
1900186	a,I saw the sea of blood. That day..I.. Ahhhh!\0
1900187	a,I couldn't run.. I saw... Everything! I was already dead then. Kehe...hahaha..\0
1900188	a,I'm gonna get caught! Then you'll die! Ahh! God have forsaken us!\0
1900189	a,I want to live! I don't want to be swallowed to death!\0
1900190	a,Nothing comes out neither from inside or outside.\0
1900191	a,As it didn't exist \0
1900192	a,It left nothing behind.. \0
1900193	a,Should we report it to the kingdom?\0
1900194	a,I'm in a pickle. We can't go back. Let's look further.\0
1900195	a,We'll begin internal purification process.\0
1900196	a,Please. \0
1900197	a,Nothing can be found. \0
1900198	a,As if it didn't exist from the beginning \0
1900199	a,Hm.. \0
1900200	a,I heard the witness went crazy after this incident. \0
1900201	a,I think we must begin purifying this bad aura before we do anything. \0
1900202	a,I will report to Kingdom. \0
1900203	a,Yes. You can do that. \0
1900204	a,From what I heard from the witness, I heard the monsters were completely ripped apart and absorbed into the ground. \0
1900205	a,He's a crazy man, so it's not so credible... \0
1900206	a,Sigh.. It doesn't make sense that this brutal scene has nothing left behind. \0
1900207	a,What should we do?\0
1900208	a,Let's report it to the kingdom first. \0
1900209	a,Okay.\0
1900210	a,A crazy man said all the monsters were shredded and absorbed into the ground. \0
1900211	a,What do you think? \0
1900212	a,Unbelievable words from unbelievable man. \0
1900213	a,I think so too. But, there's no practical way to explain why the monsters have disappeared..  \0
1900214	a,Sigh.. We'll begin internal purification process.  \0
1900215	a,Yes. Then I will report back to the Kingdom. \0
1900216	a,I can't believe it. \0
1900217	a,Monsters all disappeared at once... \0
1900218	a,I never felt this kind of deep darkness before. \0
1900219	a,I wonder if we can purify this. \0
1900220	a,This may be difficult, but please.  \0
1900221	a,Stop outsiders from approaching. \0
1900222	a,Okay. \0
1900223	a,Sigh..\0
1900224	a,Other places can't seem to find anything either. \0
1900225	a,If it's even possible for all monsters to disappear from all catacombs and necropolis... \0
1900226	a,The witness went crazy. He's not being very helpful. \0
1900227	a,I think we must eliminate this dark aura first.\0
1900228	a,I think you should investigate afterwards. \0
1900229	a,Please. \0
1900230	a,Do you think it's possible for all monsters to disappear at once? \0
1900231	a,I.. don't believe that it's possible.\0
1900232	a,I don't think it's possible... \0
1900233	a,The witness went crazy. His words are meaningless. \0
1900234	a,Sigh.. It's tiring trying to guess. \0
1900235	a,First.. Please take care of the purification process. \0
1900236	a,Then I will report back to the Kingdom. \0
1900237	a,Okay. \0
1900238	a,I'm worried. \0
1900239	a,Other places can't seem to find anything either. \0
1900240	a,Do you think it's possible for all monsters to disappear from all catacombs and necropolis?\0
1900241	a,The witness went crazy. He's not being very helpful. \0
1900242	a,I think we must eliminate this dark aura first. \0
1900243	a,Please.\0
1900244	a,Ahh.. What should we do with this situation... \0
1900245	a,Calm down. \0
1900246	a,Does it even make sense that all monsters from Catacomb and Necropolis disappeared?\0
1900247	a,This has never happened in the past. \0
1900248	a,First.. Calm down... \0
1900249	a,Shilen...Shilen may be resurrecting... \0
1900250	a,Sigh.. First... I will start with purification process. \0
1900251	a,When you're calm, please report to the kingdom. \0
1900252	a,What do you think? \0
1900253	a,This doesn't seem like an ordinary situation. \0
1900254	a,If that crazy man's words are true... Monsters... May have been... absorbed by Shilen. \0
1900255	a,Shilen.. I don't even know how to report for this. \0
1900256	a,I will purify this place first. \0
1900257	a,Please. \0
1900258	a,What he said is out of ordinary.  \0
1900259	a,The monsters were shredded into pieces and absorbed into the ground... \0
1900260	a,This is not something any person can do. \0
1900261	a,Then... I see... Shilen sounds like a viable theory. \0
1900262	a,It may not be the truth. \0
1900263	a,You may be correct.\0
1900264	a,We should report to the Kingdom first.\0
1900265	a,Okay. \0
1900266	a,Ha.. I have no idea. \0
1900267	a,I can't find any trace. Any trace of the monsters!\0
1900268	a,Calm down. \0
1900269	a,No race can do such thing. \0
1900270	a,If anyone could... he would be 'God.'\0
1900271	a,First.. We'll purify this evil aura. \0
1900272	a,Please. \0
1900273	a,We'll go into investigation when the purification is complete. \0
1900274	a,Okay. \0
1900275	a,What do you think about what that crazy man said?\0
1900276	a,It sounds like crazy talk from a crazy man?\0
1900277	a,When there's no proof... Don't you think it sounds pretty credible?\0
1900278	a,You're putting too much weight into it.\0
1900279	a,It's unrealistic that all monsters would disappear at once. \0
1900280	a,Even if you believe that... there's really not much we can do. \0
1900281	a,Please purify inside of the building. \0
1900282	a,Okay. \0
1900283	a,It's a strange thing. \0
1900284	a,Right. It's definitely not a human being can do. \0
1900285	a,Monsters all disappeared at once... \0
1900286	a,Do you think God did this? \0
1900287	a,Someone who can do this... is probably... Goddess of Death...\0
1900288	a,That's the worst guess. \0
1900289	a,I think it's best that we do not tell the Kingdom yet. \0
1900290	a,We must find something that can be a clue... \0
8888100	a,Listen! The Realm of Light will kneel in front of Goddess Shilen.\0
8888101	a,Sacrifice of blood for resurrection and destruction!\0

1801463	a,My sharp blade is thirsty for your blood...\0
1801464	a,Do not interfere. Are you using violence inside the fortress?!\0
1801465	a,There are mountains of corpses of those who attacked me without taking me seriously...\0
1801466	a,I will slash your flesh with this rune sword!\0
1801467	a,Huhuhu... What curious people you are.\0
1801468	a,Slowly... And with suspense!\0
1801469	a,You're laughing? Go ahead! Then, you will die.\0
1801470	a,Taste the sharpness of my blade and die.\0
1801471	a,Stab and twist. Simple, right?\0
1801472	a,My sword will cut through your armor like paper.\0
1801473	a,Ha!\0
1801474	a,What a pathetic end to carelessness...\0
1801475	a,I cannot stand any longer.\0
1801476	a,A bit more... Clench the teeth! Kyah!\0
1801477	a,Now, don't die too easily.\0
1801478	a,I am the guillotine. If you remember me from the past, that will be your carelessness.\0
1801479	a,See this nightmarish truth. How would you like to see your comrades die?\0
1801480	a,Your group attacks so easily. I am alone.\0
1801481	a,Swing and strike! You are just a lump of flesh.\0
1801482	a,Puhahahahaha! This is fun!\0
1801483	a,You killed many of my subordinates.\0
1801484	a,You can stand it, right? Good! That's good! Hahaha!\0
1801485	a,I'm getting more and more excited!\0
1801486	a,Insects! Insignificant bugs to be killed!\0
1801487	a,I'm the boss of this place! How dare you act with such impudence!!!\0
1801488	a,I'm feeling power! Must be Katarsis on the battlefield! Hahaha!\0
1801489	a,I hate all of you who are alive!\0
1801490	a,Undead? Don't label me so easily!\0
1801491	a,Kuhahahahaha! C'mon! Try some more!!\0
1801492	a,I will tear your soul at the tip of my spear.\0
1801493	a,Protect feelings? When you die, die with certainty!\0
1801494	a,This fortress is not your playground! How dare you!\0
1801495	a,Sadness surrounds me.\0
1801496	a,Do you know how it feels to die on those you love?\0
1801497	a,I will bring peace back to this place.\0
1801498	a,The guillotine of death is hiding your identity.\0
1801499	a,The guillotine always makes me cower.\0
1801500	a,Sometimes, I cannot accept my death.\0
1801501	a,I died without mercy in this place.\0
1801502	a,My brutal curse keeps me trapped in this place.\0
1801503	a,I cannot rely on anyone anymore.\0
1801504	a,Hurry and escape from this place...\0
1801505	a,I love you. Please don't forget me.\0
1801506	a,I really didn't want to die.\0
1801507	a,You! Can you see me?\0
1801508	a,This place is all filled with suffocating darkness!\0
1801509	a,My body was beaten to a pulp.\0
1801510	a,I will never forget the face of my torturer...!\0
1801511	a,My entire body was destroyed by fear.\0
1801512	a,No! Go away! Don't let anyone come toward me...!\0
1801513	a,I left my family behind and was dragged to this place.\0
1801514	a,If I let go of my grudge, will I be able to escape from this place?\0
1801515	a,I want to feel the ground under my feet. But I no longer have any weight.\0
1801516	a,Hot! Too hot!\0
1801517	a,The air here feels like it's burning!\0
1801518	a,Get away! Get that fire away from me!\0
1801519	a,Ack! AAAHHHH!!\0
1801520	a,I'm always covered in sweat. So pitiful...\0
1801521	a,I don't know how many times I pleaded for my life.\0
1801522	a,Please destroy the guillotine. That is my wish!\0
1801523	a,Crackle crackle... That sound drives me crazy.\0
1801524	a,I remember the eyes of the monsters that looked upon me...\0
1801525	a,Please... just kill me...\0
1801526	a,I hate red. The color of fire... and blood...\0
1801527	a,Kkk... Did you see that mysterious image at night?\0
1801528	a,I want to see the image that appears in the darkness.\0
1801529	a,Darkness and annihilation. Don't those words go well together?\0
1801530	a,Things you cannot see during the day appear at night.\0
1801531	a,Don't walk around carelessly. You might die in an instant!\0
1801532	a,Rare life forms appear here from time to time.\0
1801533	a,Have you ever held the Proof of Survival in your hand?\0
1801534	a,They say that the monster that carries around treasure holds it.\0
1801535	a,Isn't it illogical to search for money in a barren land?\0
1801536	a,Let go of your greed. There is a greater reward waiting for you.\0
1801537	a,Let go of the things you desire, so that good fortune finds you...\0
1801538	a,Treasure the time that you have, even if it's only 10 minutes.\0
1801539	a,People can obtain a great fortune in a short amount of time.\0
1801540	a,Don't worry about me. I will speak the truth until my dying day.\0
1801541	a,The mandragora plants had many varieties.\0
1801542	a,Skull Dissect... That monster doesn't dare show itself.\0
1801543	a,Do not fear their shields. It is just an illusion.\0
1801544	a,Do not obsess over the small things. Look with a wide view...\0
1801545	a,Their shields are strong. But they are also careless!\0
1801546	a,Hun.. hungry...\0
1801547	a,Aha~\0
1801548	a,If it's a lot, I'll eat more.\0
1801549	a,Wooowww!\0
1801550	a,No way! Stop! Ack!\0
1801551	a,You lot...!!\0
1801552	a,I'm getting hungry.\0
1801553	a,Your kids are really cute.\0
1801554	a,Have a good and safe day.\0
1801555	a,Who's there?\0
1801556	a,Where do you think you are?\0
1801557	a,Hey, stop!\0
1801558	a,You killed our baby!\0

3000000	a,Heh, I'll tell you about your face. Let me see you better. Raise your head. \0
3000001	a,What? This is a face? Amazing. Should I recommend you to a plastic surgeon?\0
3000002	a,Hmm... not bad.\0
3000003	a,Wow, I've never seen a face like yours! Gorgeous! Your eyes, nose, and lips are the best!\0
3000004	a,Let me assess your body! Turn around. \0
3000005	a,Argh! What's this? Can't keep my eyes open!\0
3000006	a,Well... you are alright. You need to exercise more though.\0
3000007	a,Wow! You look very healthy!\0
3000008	a,I'll check your luck with money. Let's see what the future has in store for you.\0
3000009	a,Well, let's not be friends. You'll be losing a lot of Adena. Don't even ask me to lend you some! \0
3000010	a,Your luck with money isn't that bad. That doesn't mean I'll lend you money, though. Hmph.\0
3000011	a,Let's be good friends! You'll have plenty of Adena throughout your life! \0
3000012	a,Let me check your personality. Let's see how good of a person you are.\0
3000013	a,Er. You have no friends, am I right? You have to be nice to get friends! \0
3000014	a,At least it looks like people like you.\0
3000015	a,Oh wow, are you a reincarnation of Buddha? How about changing your nickname to Dalai Lama?\0
3000016	a,You need to be fashionable to be popular. Let me check your fashion sense.\0
3000017	a,What?! Hip-hop pants and a loose t-shirt? Red socks?! Ugh!\0
3000018	a,You are normal. Try to find something unique though.\0
3000019	a,Wow! You dress like a celebrity! Great!\0
3000020	a,Let me check your luck with romantic relationships. I want to know!\0
3000021	a,How sad. You don't have any luck in this area. Just get a pet if you are lonely.\0
3000022	a,You are pretty lucky. You'll live a happy married life.\0
3000023	a,Wow! How many people have you met! \0
3000024	a,How about doing some business? Want me to check your luck in that area?\0
3000025	a,Nope. No. Absolutely no. Don't you even think about doing business.\0
3000026	a,Oh, you will be just fine doing business. How about starting a shop in Giran?\0
3000027	a,Well, it looks like you'll become the next billionaire. Adena will just keep pouring in!\0
3000028	a,What's your IQ? Want me to test you?\0
3000029	u,Do you know what the IQ of a whale is? Hmm? Well, your score is lower than that…\0
3000030	a,You are average. You'll be just fine getting through life. \0
3000031	a,You are like Einstein and Stephen Hawking! How about studying nuclear engineering or physics?\0
3000032	a,Are you good with speeches? I'll check how good you are.\0
3000033	a,Er. How about taking some speech classes? I'm sure it will come in handy.\0
3000034	a,Not bad at all. You can talk your way through anything.\0
3000035	a,Why don't you get into politics? You'll be great!\0
3000036	a,Humor is vital in this day and age. Let me see how you rank in that aspect.\0
3000037	a,Well, you better keep your mouth shut. Don't even try to make a joke.\0
3000038	a,Not bad. People love your wit.\0
3000039	a,How do you keep up with the latest trends? Amazing! So witty!\0
3000040	a,Let's test your stamina. \0
3000041	a,Huh. Your body's real age is 70. Try exercising some more. I recommend squats.\0
3000042	a,You are overflowing with power. Just right for your age. \0
3000043	a,This power...! Your stamina is the best I've seen!\0
3000044	a,How about testing your fighting abilities? Equip your items and let's see. \0
3000045	a,Can you even defeat one monster? There's something called enchantment, you know?\0
3000046	a,You're good enough to be in a party, I guess.\0
3000047	a,Your party members must love you! I'm sure you can kill multiple monsters at once!\0
3000048	a,It's a dance party! Show me your moves. I'll tell you how good you are.\0
3000049	a,Huh? That's dancing? I've never seen anything like that.\0
3000050	a,That's right! You got some good moves.\0
3000051	a,You are the reincarnation of Michael Jackson! Amazing!\0
3000052	a,Food is one of the necessities of life! How are your cooking skills?\0
3000053	a,Ugh! Is this edible? Well... thank you for the food, but I'll pass. \0
3000054	a,Oh, this is good. Party at your house next week?\0
3000055	a,This is the best thing I've ever had! So delicious!\0
3000056	a,Are you currently a clan leader or do you dream of becoming one? I'll take a look at your leadership skills.\0
3000057	a,Do you have a dog or a cat at home? I'm sure not even they listen to you.\0
3000058	a,You should be fine leading a small group of friends.\0
3000059	a,No one can say no to you! Great leadership! How about starting a clan?\0
3000060	a,Lineage 2 is all about the community. Let's see how sociable you are.\0
3000061	a,Do you have anyone on your friends list? You play by yourself, huh?\0
3000062	a,You are sociable enough to have quite a few friends. \0
3000063	a,Do you have like a thousand friends? You can get close to someone you just met, right?\0
3000064	a,How many true friends do you have? The more stars that show up, the greater the number of true friends that you have.\0
3000065	a,Aw, you don't have that many friends. Don't worry, I'll be your friend.\0
3000066	a,Three true friends! Treat them well. They'll be your friends forever.\0
3000067	a,You have a lot of true friends. Can I become one of your true friends as well?\0
3000068	a,How good are you at singing? Go ahead, I want to hear you sing.\0
3000069	a,Was that you singing? I thought you were just shouting.\0
3000070	a,Well, at least you can hit the right notes. Not bad.\0
3000071	a,Wow, you are a great singer! I'm sure you are always the life of the party!\0
3000072	a,Crafting is the life of Lineage 2. Want me to check your luck with crafting?\0
3000073	a,Nope. Don't try crafting. You'll fail every single time.\0
3000074	a,At least you'll break even and gain some. How about talking to a maestro in the village?\0
3000075	a,You'll make a lot of money with crafting. Try crafting something expensive!\0
3000076	a,Weapons that turn blue and red! Want me to check your luck with enchanting today?\0
3000077	a,Nope. Don't try enchanting. Just don't.\0
3000078	a,You'll have no problems getting to + 6. You shouldn't try to go higher than that, though.\0
3000079	a,Eek! If you enchant something right now you'll get it up to + 14! Lady Luck is on your side!\0
3000080	a,I'll check how good you were with relationships in your prime years.\0
3000081	a,No need to tell me anything. I'm sure you've gone on lonely walks at the park many times. How sad.\0
3000082	a,You've had your share of experiences with a significant other, I see.\0
3000083	a,How many people have you met!\0
3000084	a,Are you nice to your party members? I'll rate how nice you are.\0
3000085	a,How could you? You join a party and don't even look at your screen after that, huh?\0
3000086	a,Oh, you know how to treat your party members well. I'm sure you're loved by many.\0
3000087	a,If everyone could be just like you! You are so nice to everyone!\0
3000088	a,I'll check your health. Take a deep breath. Now stick out your tongue.\0
3000089	a,Hmm. How old are you? I know a good facility for the elderly. Should I refer you there?\0
3000090	a,You are doing well. Remember to get a checkup from time to time, though. \0
3000091	a,Great! I'm sure you'll live to be 130 years old! \0
3000092	a,I'll check your speed. Try running around.\0
3000093	a,Huh? It looks like you'll have to work on your speed.\0
3000094	a,You are quick! Not bad.\0
3000095	a,Did you just move? I didn't even notice.\0
3000096	a,They say that the eyes show your inner state. Let me check your eyes.\0
3000097	a,What's up with your eyes? You need more energy. \0
3000098	a,Your eyes are so pretty!\0
3000099	a,Ah! Please close your eyes. If not, I will fall into them.\0

1803096	a,Oh? This is a Flame Flower! Stand back. The Stakatos will come now.\0
1803097	a,The Flame Flowers can only be saved with the Radiant Heal skill.\0
1803098	a,Be careful. The flower will die if you hit it with another skill.\0
1803099	a,Phew.. Those Stakatos.. They shouldn't come out for a while now.\0
1803100	a,A Flame Flower! Can you believe it? It's a very magical flower. \0
1803101	a,To save a Flame Flower.. Yes, you need to use Radiant Heal!\0
1803102	a,If you try to use any other skill, the flower will die, so be careful.\0
1803103	a,Those nasty Stakatos.. Anyway, it should be fine now.\0
1803104	a,This!! I'm sure I've seen this before.. Yes.. That means, the Stakatos!!\0
1803105	a,To save the Flame Flower you need Heal.. Wait! Radiant Heal! Yes, I'm sure!\0
1803106	a,Well, there's not much difference, right? Or is there..?\0
1803107	a,Anyway, the Stakatos will not come out anymore. Why? Well..\0
1803108	a,Now, on to the next!\0
1803109	a,Hmm? What is this? I don't think I've been around here before.. This eerie feeling..\0
1803110	a,Wah! Save me! Saaaave me! I'll give you a thousand Adena!!!\0
1803111	a,Let's keep going.\0
1803112	a,What's this place? I've never seen this before.. Hmm..\0
1803113	a,Wah! Save me! Please save me!\0
1803114	a,Let's have some fun.\0
1803115	a,Let's see.. I haven't been here before. Have I? I hope we don't run into weird creatures..\0
1803116	a,Eek! Save this Dwarf! I'm just an archaeologist! I'll give you everything I have!!\0
1803117	a,Eeeek! Great! I can't believe you defeated this giant scorpion!\0
1803118	a,Well, let's keep going. Which way do you want to go? Left or right?\0
1803119	a,I have a bad feeling about both, but I'll trust you guys.\0
1803120	a,Oh? You truly are amazing. You actually defeated those nasty guys!\0
1803121	a,The path splits now. Well, let's go! Which way?\0
1803122	a,Both look pretty bad, but we must keep going!\0
1803123	a,Eek! Don't bring it here. Anyway, you really are strong.\0
1803124	a,Let's hurry. Which way? Test your luck at this crossroads.\0
1803125	a,I'm worried either way, but I'll trust you guys.\0
1803126	a,This way? Well, I trust you. I'll be safe, right?\0
1803127	a,What! Look, this place isn't safe either!\0
1803128	a,Eek! What..? Wait! I'll be waiting over there..\0
1803129	a,You are decided? Well, let's hurry!\0
1803130	a,Wahhh! It's dangerous! Watch out!\0
1803131	a,Wait! I mean, good job. I'll just be waiting over there..\0
1803132	a,This way? I see. Okay. I just need to follow you, right?\0
1803133	a,Wahhh! This way was dangerous too! Save me!\0
1803134	a,Huh? I think I saw something. I'll be right back.\0
1803135	a,This way feels much safer. Good choice. The air feels different.\0
1803136	a,Wahhh! What are these monsters! How old do you have be to get that big!\0
1803137	a,Please get rid of these monsters. I'm sure it will be easy for you. I.. Have something to take care of..\0
1803138	a,Okay, it does look better than the other way. The air feels better already.\0
1803139	a,Again!! Please do something about those monsters! Where do they keep coming from?\0
1803140	a,I'll leave those monsters to you. I'll go check out something over there. It's very important.\0
1803141	a,Well, does it matter which way we go? I hope it's better than the other one at least.. Something smells good here.\0
1803142	a,Wahh! Why do these monsters keep coming out? I should hunt them all and make some drinks.. Wah! Don't come near me!\0
1803143	a,Do something about these monsters! Show me your strength! I'll be waiting over there..\0
1803144	a,Oh! I've never been this far. This ancient language.. Isn't it beautiful?\0
1803145	a,It says.. "The Sealed Tablet and the Sealing Device are one body.. The Flame Flowers will be your blessing.."\0
1803146	a,The seal is coming apart! Just a little more!\0
1803147	a,Yes! The seal is gone. Well, you go on ahead. I'll make some rubbed copies first.\0
1803148	a,This.. Looks like instructions on how to remove the seal..\0
1803149	a,Sealed Tablet.. Attack.. The Flame Flowers.. Oh! Plant the Flame Flowers around the tablet and attack it! Now!\0
1803150	a,Yes! The seal is coming apart. Come on, let's do this!\0
1803151	a,The seal is gone! Let's go now! I'll look around once more. You go on ahead!\0
1803152	a,Hmm.. Can you read this? I should've paid more attention in the ancient language class..\0
1803153	a,Well, we should try to destroy the tablet first. Something should happen then, right?\0
1803154	a,Oh, yes! Look at that. The seal is breaking! Just a little more.\0
1803155	a,Wow! The seal is gone! Ohhh! That's a pretty big hole. Well, grab on to my hand, and you may go in first.\0
1803156	a,What's going on? Everyone's fighting very hard for me, I see.\0
1803157	a,Huh? You actually thought we were going to share the treasures? Hah! Nice try.\0
1803158	a,The powerful Tauti! I finally got it! It's mine!! Kahaha.\0
1803159	a,This power.. I can feel it! Hm? Huh? What's this? Gwahhh!\0
1803160	a,You are all fighting so hard for me! \0
1803161	a,You fools! These treasures are mine! I was just using you all. Kuhaha.\0
1803162	a,Tauti! The weapon that grants great power! This is mine now! Kahahaha!\0
1803163	a,Kuh! What's this? I thought I would get more power..! Gwahhh!\0
1803164	a,Nice, nice. I see that everyone's fighting hard for me.\0
1803165	a,I can't believe you actually fell for that. I was just using you. Kahaha.\0
1803166	a,Tauti! So this is Tauti. Give me your power! You are mine! Kahahaha!\0
1803167	a,Kahahaha! I can feel the power. Yes.. This..? What.. This is not it! Gwah!\0
1803168	a,Phew! It's hot in here. I've been here for over twenty years, but this is way too hot.\0
1803169	a,Have I told you? My brothers' names are Ceton and Eton. Hahaha\0
1803170	a,I used to be lean when I was young, but I guess this belly fat comes with age. You could say this is attractive in its own way.\0
1803171	a,I heard that Tyrr Warrior Dwarves can't attack long range when jumping. Is that true? Just wondering..\0
1803172	a,People used to think I was very old when I was a kid, but nowadays, everyone says I look younger than I am! Hahaha.\0
1803173	a,You don't belong here!\0
1803174	a,An evil thing has been sealed here. Do not get any closer.\0
1803175	a,Are you not afraid of the gods' wrath?\0
1803176	a,Do not lust after what's sealed here. It is not yours.\0
1803177	a,I will forgive you if you retreat now.\0
1803178	a,How stupid. Ignorance is a sin. I'll let you go this one time. Go!\0
1803179	a,I cannot let those who were not able to win against themselves advance any further.\0
1803180	a,Gods. Please show your powers to those who seek the devil.\0
1803181	a,Don't even dream about it! Those who are not qualified won't even get a chance!\0
1803182	a,Tauti is a cursed weapon. It must not be awakened.\0
1803183	a,Why don't you believe me!\0
1803184	a,Why are you seeking the devil's weapon? Stop!\0
1803185	a,Do not let things get worse than this.\0
1803186	a,Tauti must remain sealed here.\0
1803187	a,The seal must not be undone.\0
1803188	a,We have infiltrators. Protect the princess!\0
1803189	a,How dare you come in to the princess' room!\0
1803190	a,They came all the way here? We must stop them!\0
1803191	a,Die, you monster!\0
1803192	a,Guhhhh.\0
1803193	a,Are you ready to hear the story?\0
1803194	a,I'll start once everyone is seated.\0
1803195	a,Heh! What should I talk about next? Hmm..\0
1803196	a,Well, which story do you want to hear?\0
1803197	a,I wonder what kind of stories are popular with the customers..\0
1803198	a,Sit down first. I can't start otherwise.\0
1803199	a,Should I start? Let's see if we're ready..\0
1803200	a,I'll be starting now, so take a seat. \0
1803201	a,Which story do you want to hear?\0
1803202	a,I have many stories to tell.\0
1803203	a,Please sit down so that I can start.\0
1803204	a,Well! Whose story should I tell you today?\0
1803205	a,Hurry! Sit down!\0
1803206	a,Whose story do you want to hear?\0
1803207	a,You have to be ready.\0
1803208	a,Ice Knights got in. Defeat the Ice Knights.\0
1803209	a,Ice Knights have appeared. Defeat the Ice Knights.\0
1803210	a,Ifrit!!\0
1803211	a,Arimanes!!\0
1803212	a,Look around. The Flame Flowers have bloomed.\0
1803213	a,A crossroads? I have a bad feeling about this.\0
1803214	a,Left or right? Which way?\0
1803215	a,Look at that Flame Golem. It's terrifying.\0
1803216	a,A bunch of Flame Scarabs appeared. Watch out!\0
1803217	a,Wow, a Sealed Tablet! It says to plant the Flame Flowers around and to attack the tablet.\0
1803218	a,Let's go down this way. I'll be right behind you.\0
1803219	a,There's no future for those who cannot win against themselves.\0
1803220	a,Look at yourself and face yourself.\0
1803221	a,A battle against yourself is more terrifying than death itself.\0
1803222	a,The Mystic Tavern is open now.\0
1803223	a,There's a tavern where you can listen to wonderful stories.\0
1803224	a,Are you looking for the tavern? It's this way.\0
1803225	a,Come on! Chances like these don't come by often.\0
1803226	a,Adventurer! The tavern is this way.\0
1803227	a,Sigh.. Busy as always.\0
1803228	a,How long until we can tell stories to the customers too?\0
1803229	a,I wonder what Hanna will be making today..\0
1803230	a,Hey, you! We don't want drunk customers here.\0
1803231	a,What do you think about our tavern? Isn't it great?\0
1803232	a,You can place your order over there.\0
1803233	a,Just relax and have a drink.\0
1803234	a,Hanna's cooking is the best.\0
1803235	a,You are a regular, right? Thanks for coming again.\0
1803236	a,Here, you can forget about your responsibilities for a while.\0
1803237	a,You can hear the story over there.\0
1803238	a,Oh! It's a Flame Flower that is famous for its miracles!\0
1803239	a,It's a Flame Flower. These should come in handy later on.\0
1803240	a,A crossroads.. I don't know which way we should take.\0
1803241	a,Well, how about you spit on your hand and see..\0
1803242	a,It's a Flame Golem! Watch out!\0
1803243	a,Ahhhh! A Flame Golem! Please help me!\0
1803244	a,That Flame Scarab.. It's terrifying!\0
1803245	a,Please get rid of all the Flame Scarabs!\0
1803246	a,A Sealed Tablet, huh.. \0
1803247	a,It looks like something will happen if we attack the Sealed Tablet.\0
1803248	a,Who would have thought there would be a secret region like this! Please! After you. \0
1803249	a,I'll follow you soon. Go on ahead.\0
1803250	a,Thank you for helping. You are the heroes of this era.\0
1803251	a,Moooo, mooo.\0
1803252	a,Baa, baa.\0
1803253	a,Urggghh\0
1803254	a,Urgh\0
1803255	a,What your step.\0
1803256	a,Lupia introduced me here, so that's how I started working here.\0
1803257	a,Is there anything to clean up?\0
1803258	a,I wonder if there's anyone coming from that side.\0
1803259	a,I think we can wait for some more customers.\0
1803260	a,An intense cold is coming. Look around.\0
1803261	a,Use your mouse to move more smoothly.\0
1803262	a,$s1, you obtained a Flame Flower.\0
1803263	a,$s1 obtained a Flame Flower. Amazing!\0
